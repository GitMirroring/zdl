ZigzagDownLoader (ZDL)

Use (the order of the topics is not important):
  zdl [OPTIONS] [FILE_1 FILE_2 ...] [LINK_1 LINK_2 ...] [DIR]

         FILE_n                Names of the files from which to extract the LINKS.
                               The files must be textual
                               or DLC container or TORRENT file,
                               the latter marked respectively
                               from the extensions .dlc and .torrent
                               ($PROG still processes the LINKS in memory
                               in the DIR and those in input)

         LINK_n                URL of files or web pages
                               hosting, streaming services
                               or redirection (if omitted,
                               $PROG processes those in memory
                               in the DIR and in the FILE).
                               To download via IRC/XDCC, the link
                               must have the following form (port
                               not necessary if it is 6667):
                                 irc://[HOST[:PORT]]/[CHAN]/msg [PRIVMSG]

                               ZDL also accepts xWeasel links
                               (with protocol xdcc://)

         DIR                   $PROG startup directory
                               and destination for downloads
                               (if omitted, it is the current one)

  -i,  --interactive           Launch the interactive ZDL interface for
                               the downloads targeting
                               current directory. Managed downloads can
                               be active or registered in temporary files
                               of the directory

  -d,  --daemon                Start ZDL in \"daemon\" mode (can be

                                       downloaded
                                 FILE: text file in which file names are registered

  -r,  --resume                Recover or download partially downloaded files.
                               It acts in case of homonymy between files (read the manual).
                               It can be configured as the default behavior.

       --no-complete           Delete temporary files of completed downloads

       --no-stop               Start without interruption: skip any automatic

  -g,  --gui                   Start the graphical interface in the current directory or
                               in that eventually inserted between the arguments,
                               automatically activating 'zdl --daemon' as a core
                               if you have not yet activated zdl

       --path-gui              Before starting zdl, opens a selection window
                               of the destination directory, if it is not indicated
                               between the command arguments (useful if 'zdl --gui'
                               is started from a desktop icon or extension
                               web browser, such as 'External Application Button')

                               If not indicated, the port is the default one.

  --web-ui
                               Web user interface. Start:
                               - the program in daemon mode in the current directory or,
                                 eventually, in the one inserted as an argument,

                               - a socket at the default port or, if used
                                 by another application, to the first free port

                               - the default browser at the user interface address.


IRC / XDCC:
  -x,  --xdcc                  Start the interactive insertion of three data:
                               1) the host of the IRC server (HOST)
                               2) the channel to connect to (CHAN)
                               3) the private message (PRIVMSG) that contains
                                  the XDCC SEND command

                               alternatively and without using options, by entering the
                               information in the link, which must have the
                               following form (port not necessary if it is 6667):
                                  irc://[HOST[:PORT]]/[CHAN]/msg [PRIVMSG]
