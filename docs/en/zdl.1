.SH DESCRIPTION\	
\fIZigzagDownLoader\fP is a download manager:

.RS 5

.RS 0
.IP "\fI-\fP" 2

.RS 0
.IP "\fI-\fP" 2
handles downloads of some downloaders such as \fIAria2\fP, \fIAxel\fP, \fIWget\fP, \fIRTMPDump\fP or \fIcURL\fP, using its potential (for example, download acceleration);
.RS 0
.IP "\fI-\fP" 2
extracts the URL of the files to be downloaded from file hosting and video streaming services, also using \fByoutube-dl\fP extensions (or \fIextractors\fP);
.RS 0
.IP "\fI-\fP" 2
downloads \fITORRENT\fP;
.RS 0
.IP "\fI-\fP" 2
automatically requests and downloads files via \fIIRC/XDCC\fP, without any human interaction via chat;
.RS 0
.IP "\fI-\fP" 2
downloads movies \fILIVE\fP from some television networks
.RS 0
.IP "\fI-\fP" 2

.RS 0
.IP "\fI-\fP" 2
the \fIExternal Application Button\fP extension integrates ZDL into \fIFirefox\fP, \fIChrome/Chromium\fP and \fIOpera\fP;
.RS 0
.IP "\fI-\fP" 2
using \fICygwin\fP, it also works in \fIMicrosoft Windows\fP (CLI and TUI interfaces, also from \fIFirefox\fP + \fIFlashgot\fP of Windows).

.RS -5


The server and web interfaces, for remote and network control, make it a useful tool for a \fINetwork Attached Storage\fP (\fINAS\fP)\&. The interfaces are \fIresponsive\fP and suitable for different devices. In particular, they can also be used as a remote control for launching multimedia files already downloaded or being downloaded, using a web browser on mobile devices.

Furthermore, the Web interfaces (\fIWeb-UI\fP) and graphics (\fIGUI\fP) allow the quick and intuitive search and selection of \fIfiles via XDCC\fP, without having to perform any IRC/chat.
All interfaces allow \fIlive-tv\fP recordings to be programmed.

But ZDL is also much more, because it can be:

.RS 5

.RS 0
.IP "\fI-\fP" 2
combined with other programs or inserted into a script, as a work tool
.RS 0
.IP "\fI-\fP" 2
extended by the user, who can develop new extensions suitable for their purposes
.RS 0
.IP "\fI-\fP" 2
a polyglot system, using different interpreters (for PHP, Javascript, Python, Perl, Awk \&...) and Bash tools

.RS -5


ZigzagDownLoader is a "zigzag" program: it is not just a program, it is a laboratory and a system open to new inventions.
