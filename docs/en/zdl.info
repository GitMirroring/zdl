ZigzagDownLoader (ZDL)
**********************

_ZigzagDownLoader_ is a download manager:
   - equipped with command line user interfaces (_CLI_), for terminals
     (_TUI_), graphics (_GUI_) and for internet and web applications
     (_Web-UI_);

   - handles downloads of some downloaders such as _Aria2_, _Axel_,
     _Wget_, _RTMPDump_ or _cURL_, using its potential (for example,
     download acceleration);

   - extracts the URL of the files to be downloaded from file hosting
     and video streaming services, also using `youtube-dl' extensions
     (or _extractors_);

   - downloads _TORRENT_;

   - automatically requests and downloads files via _IRC/XDCC_, without
     any human interaction via chat;

   - downloads movies _LIVE_ from some television networks

   - extends web browsers, such as _Conkeror_, _XXXTerm/Xombrero_ and,
     using _Flashgot_, _Firefox_;

   - the _External Application Button_ extension integrates ZDL into
     _Firefox_, _Chrome/Chromium_ and _Opera_;

   - using _Cygwin_, it also works in _Microsoft Windows_ (CLI and TUI
     interfaces, also from _Firefox_ + _Flashgot_ of Windows).

   The server and web interfaces, for remote and network control, make
it a useful tool for a _Network Attached Storage_ (_NAS_). The
interfaces are _responsive_ and suitable for different devices. In
particular, they can also be used as a remote control for launching
multimedia files already downloaded or being downloaded, using a web
browser on mobile devices.

   Furthermore, the Web interfaces (_Web-UI_) and graphics (_GUI_)
allow the quick and intuitive search and selection of _files via XDCC_,
without having to perform any IRC/chat.  All interfaces allow _live-tv_
recordings to be programmed.

   But ZDL is also much more, because it can be:
   - combined with other programs or inserted into a script, as a work
     tool

   - extended by the user, who can develop new extensions suitable for
     their purposes

   - a polyglot system, using different interpreters (for PHP,
     Javascript, Python, Perl, Awk ...) and Bash tools

   ZigzagDownLoader is a "zigzag" program: it is not just a program, it
is a laboratory and a system open to new inventions.

The ZDL command
***************

ZDL is a Bash program, written mainly with the Bash language. Below is
a summary of the synopsis, options and other arguments of the command
`zdl'. For more information, consult the specialized sections. ZDL is
prepared for the automatic completion of the arguments (use the `<Tab>'
key).

Synopsis
========

`zdl [_OPTIONS_] [_file_ ...] [_link_ ...] [_directory_]'

Arguments
=========

The order of options and other arguments is not important:

_file_
     File names from which to extract the _link_. The files must be
     text or DLC containers or TORRENT files, the latter marked by the
     extensions _.dlc_ and _.torrent_ respectively (ZDL processes the
     _links_ in memory in the _directory_ and those in input)

_link_
     URL of files or web pages of hosting, streaming or redirection
     services (if omitted, ZDL processes those in memory in _directory_
     and in _files_). To download via _IRC/XDCC_, the link must have
     the following form (port not necessary if it is 6667):
     `irc://[HOST[:PORT]]/[CHAN]/msg [PRIVMSG]'. ZDL also accepts links
     to _xWeasel_, with protocol `xdcc://'.

_directory_
     ZDL start directory and download destination (if omitted, it is
     the current one)

Other useful information.
=========================

For the following hosting services it is recommended to extend the
maximum download limit (add the `-m' option to the instructions listed
above, possibly indicating the maximum number of downloads to be made
simultaneously to proceed with the download in parallel, also through
the use of proxies

   Many servers do not allow recovery of interrupted downloads and
parallel downloading.  For these services ZDL uses Wget.

   Some services require the use of RTMPDump (in its absence, but with
limitations, of cURL)

   The other services are enabled by default for Aria2.

   To download from Sharpfile, Depositfiles and other services,
currently it is necessary to use the web browser to solve the captcha,
generate the link and start the download through the browsers adds-on
or with the ZDL booted from the terminal.

   The `--login' option enables automatic login in the event of the ZDL
configuration includes one or more accounts for the use of a hosting
service. In particular, the registration of many accounts for Easybytez
not only allows the download of files up to size at 600MB, but also
allows multiple files to be downloaded in parallel without the use of
proxies (in this case it is also necessary to specify `-m' or
`--max-downloads='). To configure the use of accounts: `zdl
[-c|--configure]'

   For each service or link, should Aria2 fail to connect, try using
Axel or Wget.

Startup mode (CLI/TUI)
**********************

ZDL can be started in different ways:

_A) To enter links and start new downloads:_
       1. automatically generating the list of download links:

             - open a terminal and enter the directory that will
               contain the downloaded files

             - start ZDL by typing the command followed by any options

             - copy the links of the files to download and paste them
               in the terminal (wrap up after each link)

             - type `M-x' (`M', the _Meta_ key, is `<Alt>', `<Ctrl>' or
               `<Esc>')


       2. Using one or more files prepared with a text editor (wrapping
          after each link) and reachable from the destination directory
          (indicate a valid path):
             - open a terminal and enter the directory that will
               contain the downloaded files (alternatively, you can
               indicate to _ZDL_ the working directory)

             - type the command `zdl' followed by the names of the
               files containing the list of links: `zdl' _path/file ..._

       3. By indicating directly to ZDL the links to be processed (if
          valid links were to be declared invalid, try _1_): `zdl'
          _link ..._

       4. From the web browser, through the use of additional
          components (_Flashgot_ for _Firefox_, the script `zdl-xterm',
          the command `zdl' in the Conkeror mini-buffer, ...), to the
          purpose of capturing and saving the stream of a video or
          another file of any type.

       5. In "daemon" mode (also from interactive mode)

       6. Using an editor, with the option `-e' or other more specific
          (for example, `--emacs-nw')

     Files, working directory and links can be entered in any order.
     All input links are saved in the file `links.txt', in the
     destination directory.

_B) To manage downloads already started in "non-interactive" and "daemon" mode:_
     by starting the interactive mode in two ways:

       1. in console from the download destination directory, using the
          command `zdl -i' or `zdl --interactive'

       2. in "non-interactive" (standard) mode, by typing the `i' key


File: zdl.info,  Node: Stop ZDL,  Next: Check the downloads,  Prev: Start ZDL,  Up: Top

Stop mode
*********

ZDL can be stopped in different ways:
   * If the downloads are managed by the "non-interactive"/standard
     mode:

       1. typing `M-k' (in this case all downloads started by ZDL in
          the specified destination directory or in the current one
          will be interrupted)

       2. typing `M-q' (all downloads already started in the current
          directory will not be interrupted, but will no longer be
          managed by ZDL until a new _standard_ or _daemon_ instance of
          the program)

   * If the downloads are managed by the "daemon" mode: through the
     interactive mode `zdl -i' started in the directory managed by the
     daemon, by typing the "Quit" exit key (capitalized, that is, with
     `Shift-q'): `Q' (in this case the downloads started in the
     directory will not be interrupted, but will not be managed by ZDL
     unless it is restarted to manage the same downloads)


File: zdl.info,  Node: Check the downloads,  Next: User manuals,  Prev: Stop ZDL,  Up: Top

Check downloads: recovery, deletion, shutdown, reboot ...
*********************************************************

Downloads can be controlled in different ways depending on the type of
operation to be performed.  Starting from the terminal allows the
operations listed in the command presentation to be executed: *note The
ZDL command::. Since ZDL can be closed without interrupting downloads,
this control mode can be adopted at any time, once execution has
started. _To close without interrupting downloads_:
   - if started in standard mode, type `M-q' (`<Alt> + <q>' keys)

   - from interactive mode, type `Q' (`<Shift> + <q>' keys)

   Once _closed_ (or even _killed_ interrupting downloads), ZDL can be
restarted using new options.

An example, starting from a practical problem: add options to downloads started by the browser.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Problem:_
     I want to download files from Easybytez using _Flashgot_, but also
     I want to use the options `--login', `--max-downloads=' and
     `--clean', which are not set by default. How can I use these
     additional features using the browser (with _Flashgot_), if these
     can be activated only from the terminal?

_Solution:_
        - start zdl in a terminal, from the destination directory,
          using all the options I need:     `zdl -m --login --clean'

        - using _Firefox_, I click with the right mouse button on the
          links of     download file and start the download with
          _Flashgot_: download     it is not carried out immediately
          and the links are registered by zdl for     be processed by
          another active instance of the program (that one     in the
          terminal)

        - when I finished recording the links, I go back to the
          terminal and, without     write anything, type `M-x'

Manual control of downloads.
----------------------------

ZDL processes the registered _links_, generating for each a temporary
file from which it can extract information about the file to be
downloaded and the download in progress, intact or completed. Thanks to
this information, it is possible to control the download processes,
either automatically by ZDL, or manually by the user.

   ZDL downloads can be controlled manually through the interactive
mode, which can be activated from the standard one by entering `M-i'
(`<Alt>+<i>' keys) or from any _Bash_ terminal from the same download
directory, using the `-i|--interactive' option. If there is no start-up
instance and automatic management of downloads, from the interactive
interface it is possible to start the _daemon_ mode, which acts in
background as a _server_ and is independent of the startup terminal. To
manage the downloads and the closing of ZDL in daemon mode, it is still
necessary to use an interactive interface, which acts as _client_.
The commands are listed in the same interactive interface: it is
possible to modify the maximum number of downloads (from `1' to `9', by
typing the number keys, or unlimited, by typing the key `m' or in pause
typing `0'), the type of downloader to use (Axel o Wget, by typing _a_
or _w_ or _A_), to start the default editor to edit the list of links
to be processed (_e_ key), to select, with _s_, the downloads in
management _to restart them_ (ZDL interrupts the current download and
processes the next one until the end of the registered list, then
restarts from the first and so on) or _to eliminate them_ completely.
For these last three operations it is possible to select several
downloads at a time, indicating the identification numbers separating
them with spaces.

Manual control of downloads still to be processed.
--------------------------------------------------

In the absence of temporary files related to _link_ not yet processed,
it is possible to intervene manually using an _editor_ (*note Editor::).

Modes
*****

ZDL can be used in different ways:

Standard output mode (default and _lite_: `-l, --lite').
========================================================

Two different _standard output modes_ are available: the default one,
which punctually informs the user of each operation performed,
communicating the relevant data of the downloads in progress and the
_lite_ mode, extremely compact in the representation of the downloads
and _silent_ with respect to extraction and analysis processes. The
second mode can be started with the option `-l' (`--lite') or
configured as _default_ through the configuration interface: `zdl
[-c|--configure]'. It is particularly suitable for the user who uses
ZDL as an alternative browser downloader, for example through the
_Flashgot_ extension.
The _standard output modes_ are equipped with a *note Readline:: and
accept the following commands, expressed in key combinations:

`M-i'
     start _interactive mode_. The standard output of the terminal is
     transferred to another mode, without however suspending the
     activities of the previous mode, which proceed silently.

`M-e'
     start the default editor (*note Editor::). As for the previous
     command, the activities are not suspended while using an editor to
     manipulate the list of links to be processed.

`M-c'
     clears information (temporary files) of completed downloads.

`M-q'
     allows the exit from ZDL without interrupting the downloaders,
     which continue to record useful data for a ZDL restart: downloads
     can be controlled through the functions of an _interactive mode_
     but, in the event of interruptions, they must be processed using
     _standard output_ or _daemon_ modes or through _GUI_ or _WebUI_.

`M-k'
     kills all processes started in the directory, without deleting
     temporary files.

Interactive mode (`-i, --interactive').
=======================================

Allows manual control of downloads (*note Check the downloads::) and
other operations, described in the same interface. _It does not process
links_ and it is only a _client_: to start the download it is necessary
to run an instance _server_ of ZDL, like _standard output_ or _deamon_
modes. The latter can be started from the same interactive mode.
This mode of use is the one that provides more information on the
_state_ of downloads. Its screen is automatically updated every 15
seconds or manually by typing any key.

Daemon mode (`-d, --daemon').
=============================

It silently handles all processes related to a directory and can be
controlled manually via _interactive mode_. It is independent of the
terminal in use, which can be closed without consequences. It is, in
the full sense, the _server_ mode of ZDL: the daemon mode is always
waiting for new links to be processed and ends only for user
intervention, through an interactive interface. The daemon mode
consumes less resources than other modes.

Readline
********

The execution of _standard output modes_, in the absence of an external
input (_link_ entered through the command line, a _pipe_, a container
_DLC_ or a text file, the extension of a browser ...), start the
_readline of ZDL_. It is almost identical to the Bash readline: use the
same history and type the `Enter' key to execute a command. But the ZDL
readline accepts, as commands, only links that take the form of an
_http, https or ftp_ URL, a link _irc/xdcc_ and torrent files.
In the presence of spaces in the URL, these are automatically converted
to the standard _percent code_ for URLs (any spaces to the left and
right of the URL are ignored). Each link must be entered individually,
when the _Enter_ key is pressed.
Using the mouse, you can _paste_ a list of links, but these must be
arranged in different rows.
Empty lines and links already registered are ignored, strings that do
not correspond to an URL are explicitly rejected and recorded in the
log file produced within the same directory, while accepted URLs are
recorded gradually in the file automatically managed by ZDL, such as
_download queue_.
At any time, while entering links via the readline, you can change the
_download queue_ with the default editor (*note Editor::). The download
processes are started by the command `M-x', which closes the readline
and executes the download queue.

File: zdl.info,  Node: Editor,  Next: Homonymy,  Prev: Readline,  Up: Top

Editor
******

You can check the _download queue_ through an editor. In fact, the list
of links to be processed is recorded in a temporary file managed by
ZDL. The links are processed from the first to the last: in case of
manual restart or unintentional disconnection, ZDL examines the next
link. From each mode of use of the program it is possible to start an
editor to alter the links and their order of execution.  The editor can
also be used in place of the _readline of ZDL_ (*note Readline::), from
the command line through the corresponding options (*note The ZDL
command::).
The choice of the editor can be explicit (from the command line) or
implicit, with the start of the default editor: the latter can be
specified in the ZDL configuration (`zdl [-c|--configure]' ). In the
absence of specific indications (for options and configuration), ZDL
runs the default editor for the Bash or for the operating system. If
Cygwin is used, the ZDL installer and update functions automatically
install the _Nano_ editor: it is made available if no other default
editor is present.

File: zdl.info,  Node: Homonymy,  Next: IRC/XDCC,  Prev: Editor,  Up: Top

homonymy
********

The download can become problematic in the presence of homonymous files
in the same directory, if ZDL does not already have information thanks
to which it is possible to recognize any pending or completed
downloading. This information can only be obtained from temporary files
generated by ZDL for each link already processed. Deleting these files
with the `--clean' option causes the loss of this data.
In the event that, in the presence of homonymous files, there are no
temporary files of the links to be processed, ZDL behaves in two
alternative ways:

`_default_'
     does not overwrite the homonymous file, but renames the new file
     as follows: inserts, between the name and the extension, a string
     composed of `__ BIS__' and a segment of the URL of the link,
     appropriately abbreviated and recoded. The additional string
     increases the likelihood that a homonymy problem is not repeated,
     even in the absence of temporary files from previous download
     processes. In any case, the download queue automatically cancels
     any repetitions of the same link.

``-r|--resume''
     using this option will overwrite the homonymous file. In the
     absence of temporary files related to the link to be processed,
     downloading with Axel or Aria2 also overwrites the file from the
     beginning. This option can be configured as the default behavior
     (`zdl [-c|--configure]').


File: zdl.info,  Node: IRC/XDCC,  Next: Torrent,  Prev: Homonymy,  Up: Top

IRC/XDCC
********

The download of the requested files via chat, via XDCC commands, does
not require any downloader or depends on any program: in this case,
ZigzagDownLoader, in addition to managing downloads, performs them
directly.

   The input of the necessary data (IRC server host, the port is not
necessary if it is 6667, channel, private message containing the xdcc
command) can take place in different ways:
``-x|--xdcc''
     Start the interactive insertion of the three data in succession:

       1. the host of the IRC server (_HOST[:PORT]_). If the host
          follows the channel (`irc://[HOST]/[CHAN]'), the next entry
          is skipped

       2. the channel to connect to (_CHAN_)

       3. the private message (_PRIVMSG_) containing the command `XDCC
          SEND'

``irc://[HOST[:PORT]]/[CHAN]/msg [PRIVMSG]''
     Download via IRC/XDCC can be done, alternatively and without using
     options, by entering the information directly into the link, which
     must take the form above

``xdcc://...LINK OF XWEASEL ...''
     ZigzagDownLoader automatically converts and uses xWeasel links,
     which include all the necessary information. Users who use
     Firefox/Iceweasel/Icecat/Chrome/Chromium/Opera, through these
     links, can download files directly from web pages with a click of
     the mouse, thanks to the extensions, also adapted for ZDL. Other
     browsers can download files with the same immediacy using other
     functions (in other sections: *note Conkeror::, *note zdl-xterm
     and XXXTerm/Xombrero::)



File: zdl.info,  Node: Torrent,  Next: Filters,  Prev: IRC/XDCC,  Up: Top

Torrent
*******

Aria2 allows the download of _torrents_. This downloader does not have
to be explicitly indicated to ZDL, but it must be installed correctly.
A _torrent_ can be started by simply sending the _URL magnet_ (through
all the systems provided for URLs in general, ZDL recognizes the
_magnet_ automatically) or by sending the _file torrent_, using the
`--torrent-file=' option or the file marked with the _.torrent_
extension.
The _TCP_ and _UDP_ ports can be set in the ZDL configuration (with the
command `zdl --configure' or in the file `$ HOME/.zdl/zdl.conf'),
explicitly indicated with the options `--tcp-port=' and `--udp-port='
or indicated in the _Aria2_ configuration. It is important that the
ports are opened by the router.

Filters
*******

Filtering is possible only through the use of command line options (or
through scripts that use ZDL). For advanced filters, the use of
_regular expressions [REGEX]_ can be useful.

Create new extensions
*********************

How to add custom and experimental extensions.
==============================================

ZDL incorporates the code it finds in all the bash scripts with the
extension `.sh' in the directory `$HOME/.zdl/extensions /'

   Example bash script:

     if [[ "$url_in" = ~ PATTERN ]]
     then
        url_in_file = $(sed -r 's|http://(.+)|http://USER:PASSWORD@\1|g' \
                            <<< "$url_in")
        file_in="NOME_DEL_FILE"
        max_dl=1
        axel_parts=3
        aria2_connections=3

        end_extension
     fi

   The example can be used as a template for a link recognized through
a regex in the PATTERN.  The script modifies the download link in
`$url_in' to get the URL of the file in `$url_in_file', adding USER and
PASSWORD to access the server.  Also, indicate how to get the name of
the file to download (variable `$file_in') and add or change options:
disable the `--max-downloads=' option if applied to the command and
establishes the number of parts to be downloaded with Axel (the degree
of acceleration, which by default is 32 but for several servers may be
excessive or insufficient, worsening performance) and that of Aria2
(maximum 16 connections). The `end_extension' function check if an
`file_in' exists and if `url_in_file' is valid.

   In this way, it is possible to extend ZDL to other file services
hosting (also for experimental purposes), add targeted options and
customized or implement program operation, using the variables and
functions available in ZDL without change the source

The script `zdl-xterm': XXXTerm/Xombrero and other software
***********************************************************

ZDL can be started from XXXTerm/Xombrero and from other software through
the `/usr/local/bin/zdl-xterm' script, which it can be started from any
application and from a terminal.  It was thought to make it possible to
start ZDL in different contexts from those provided by the program. In
particular, XXXTerm can start a bash script, using the command
`:run_script', passing it a single argument: the link of the current
page. This makes it impossible to start standard zdl in an instance of
xterm, because `:run_script' does not accept further parameters. The
start of zdl in a new virtual terminal xterm is made possible,
precisely, from `zdl-xterm'.

Use in XXXTerm:
===============

   - command `:run_script'

   - type: `zdl-xterm'

   - the program starts an instance of xterm which:
        * asks in which _directory_ to download the file          (You
          can avoid this interaction by configuring zdl-xterm:
          enter in `/usr/local/bin/zdl-xterm', as a value          of
          the variable `default_directory' at the beginning of the
             script, the path to a _valid directory_)

        * zdl-xterm starts zdl on the _current URL_

Simplification for XXXTerm.
---------------------------

To use zdl-xterm more quickly, XXXTerm can be configured in many ways.

   A tip:
   - open the file `$HOME/.xxxterm.conf'

   - enter the following text:
          default_script = zdl-xterm
          keybinding = run_script,C-z

   With the suggested configuration, typing `Ctrl-z' starts the prompt
`:run_script' with the field already occupied by the name of the script
`zdl-xterm': just press `enter'.

Installation and update of ZDL
******************************

ZDL installs automatically with a script for the _Bash_.

Installation for GNU/Linux
==========================

  1. Download the installer (it's a script for the Bash):
     `http://download-mirror.savannah.gnu.org/releases/zdl/install_zdl.sh'

  2. Give the execution rights to the script:    `chmod +x
     install_zdl.sh'

  3. run the script: `./install_zdl.sh'

  4.    The installation is automated and may ask you to install new
     packages    (dependencies) choosing between several options: the
     recommended option is always the number 1

  5. If everything went well, you have finished the installation

Installation for Microsoft Windows
==================================

ZDL also works on Windows, but through _Cygwin_

   Installation on Windows:
_STEP 1) Installation of Cygwin 32 bit_
     automatic Cygwin installer (also updater for the emulated system
     and installer for new packages):
     `http://cygwin.com/setup-x86.exe'
     We recommend the following mirror: `http://bo.mirror.garr.it'
     Before proceeding with the installation, read the instructions for
     the _step 2_

_STEP 2) Installation of dependencies_
     it may not be necessary as the next step includes an automatic
     (not always working) system that could be able to correctly
     install all packages requested through the use of `apt-cyg'.
     However, we recommend to install dependencies using the Cygwin
     installer, choosing the additional packages as of _step 1_.
     _List of packages to install:_ `wget ffmpeg rtmpdump diffutils
     nano coreutils vim-common openssl'
     For some packages it may be necessary to add a Cygwinports mirror:
     `http://bo.mirror.garr.it/mirrors/sourceware.org/cygwinports/'

_STEP 3) Installation of ZDL_
       1. save in the folder `C:\cygwin' (the folder may be located in
          another _device_: check also in `D:', `E:', etc.) the
          following file:
          `http://download-mirror.savannah.gnu.org/releases/zdl/install_zdl.sh'

       2. start _Cygwin_ installed in step 1

       3. type the following command: `/install_zdl.sh'

   How to use ZDL on Windows: starts Cygwin and uses ZDL in the terminal
started, as described in this guide. You can start downloading with ZDL
also from _Flashgot_ of _Firefox_ and from _Conkeror_ performed by
MS-Windows: Cygwin starts automatically.

Update ZDL
==========

If a new version of the program is available, ZDL is updated
automatically. You can disable automatic updating changing the
configuration with `zdl --configure'.

   To update ZDL manually, simply use the `-u' option (`--update').

   Manual update can be forced by adding the option `-f' (`--force')

Uninstall ZDL
=============

An uninstall script is available:
`http://download-mirror.savannah.gnu.org/releases/zdl/uninstall_zdl.sh'.

Why this program
****************

ZigzagDownLoader is an extensible, robust and fully controllable
download manager with a terminal or, through sockets, with a web
interface also suitable for a smartphone format (_-socket_, _-web-ui_).
It can be integrated to the most popular web browsers (_Firefox_,
_Chrome/Chromium_ and _Opera_) and to the desktop, using the extension
_External Application Button_ and a more friendly graphic interface (
_-gui_ and _-path-gui_).  It was born as a specific Bash script and
turned into a downloader manager for _Wget_, _Axel_ and _Aria2_
(default downloader), extending to video streaming and file hosting
services. integrating with other applications. Today ZigzagDownLoader
is also a downloader for _IRC/XDCC_: the entire download and recovery
process is automatic and requires no interaction via CHAT. Moreover,
thanks to the adoption of Aria2, ZigzagDownLoader also manages the
_TORRENT_.

   ZigzagDownLoader is a lot of things: a _server/TCP client_ useful
for a _NAS_, a _command for the terminal_, an alternative
_downloader/download manager_ and _smart_ for the browser, a _graphic
application_ for the desktop ... all this simultaneously and more.

   Despite its structural limitations, the language of the _Bash_
proved to be fit for purpose, especially for the flexibility of use in
the management of the processes of other programs. Progressive
efficiency has been achieved through the development of _monolithic_
scripts in the language of _Awk_ (_Gawk_). The software also includes
interpreters of other languages​(currently: _node.js_ and _php_,
necessary for processing the links of some services), providing support
for further extensions and developments. ZigzagDownLoader is, in some
ways, a complex example of _polyglot programming_.

At least four development guidelines
------------------------------------

The execution of the downloaders may require assistance: the connection
may be interrupted, the IP address change, the downloads get stuck, the
names of the downloaded files may not be intelligible or may coincide
with others of files already saved, etc.  _First_, ZigzagDownLoader is
used to automate the management and recovery of downloads or to
simplify any manual interventions. ZDL is designed, above all, for the
_accelerated_ download of large files and for the recovery of their
_URL_ from information available on the web or provided by the user.

   _Secondly_, automatic management is extended to file hosting, video
streaming, torrent and irc/xdcc services: ZDL replaces the user in
useless and boring operations, reducing them to the only act of
starting the program.

   _A third goal_ of the ZDL project is to provide new articulations
and methods of use, in order to build interactions between programs and
to make potentially unlimited automation possible.  Download management
can be controlled by separate terminals in different modes. For
example, ZDL can be started in _daemon_ mode and controlled in
_interactive_ mode. The _default_ startup also offers different ways of
interaction and output. Furthermore, ZDL can be integrated and
connected with other programs.

   _Finally_, a peculiarity of the ZDL project consists in the search
for efficiency and portability: the use of the tools provided by Bash
makes it possible to run on hardware with limited capacity and on
different operating systems. Designed for _GNU/Linux_, ZDL is
functional also on _Windows_ via _Cygwin_. It is technically possible
to extend its use on other operating systems that support the Bash (for
example _MacOSX_).
